# Fix-Me

 The purpose of this project is to implement simulation tools for the financial markets that exchange a sim- plified version of FIX messages. The tools will be able to communicate over a network using the TCP protocol. The focus in this project are not the trading algos (you can experiment with them after the project is finished), but the implementation of a robust and performant messaging platform.
